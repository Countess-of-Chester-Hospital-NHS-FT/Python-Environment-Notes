# Python-Environment-Notes
Notes and SOPs about how to reproduce development environments and deployment environments using conda and venv

## How to use
Read the overview for the general approach to environment management.

Refer to the glossary if ever confused about the different environment file types.

The rest are SOPs for each of the 3 things you might need to do:
* create an environment and associated files from scratch for a new project
* create a virtual environment on a server for deployment
* create a development environment from an established project using the environment files
